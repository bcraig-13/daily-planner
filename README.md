-The user may select an hour and type in a task for the specified hour. Upon clicking the "save"
button at the end of each row, the user's entries will be saved to their local storage so that upon
reloading the page they will keep their entries.

-Gray boxes will be marked by past hours, the red box will be the current hour, and the green boxes will
be future hours. This will allow the user to easily distinguish past, current, and future entries.
