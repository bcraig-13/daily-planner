### DAILY PLANNER APP
This daily planner app will allow a user to set tasks for specific hours in their day.

# USAGE
-When opening the app the current day will be listed at the top of the page.


-The user may select an hour and type in a task for the specified hour. Upon clicking the "save"
button at the end of each row, the user's entries will be saved to their local storage so that upon
reloading the page they will keep their entries.

-Gray boxes will be marked by past hours, the red box will be the current hour, and the green boxes will
be future hours. This will allow the user to easily distinguish past, current, and future entries.

# NOTES
-The app can currently save input value to local storage but it's not set up to retrieve it when the page loads.
